# Over EZ
This repository contains a suite of tools to aid brothers in creating editions of the EZ Digest.
## EZ Digest
The EZ Digest is a weekly email sent to brothers of the Epsilon Zeta chapter of Alpha Phi Omega at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Created with HTML and CSS, it provides details and sign-up links to upcoming chapter events, and includes minutes for recent brotherhood and committee meetings.
## Installation and Deployment
1. Clone this git repository by running the following command in a Git-enabled terminal:
    * `> git clone https://github.com/jzblee/over_ez.git`
2. Open the newly cloned `index.html` file in your browser.
## Usage
1. Enter the publication date on the top left. Preferably, the digest should be created in time for publishing on the next Sunday, so there is a button to help set the date to that.
2. Unless you have custom/multiple style sheets, you will want to stick with the one that's given.
3. Fill out the information for each event. You can use the sign-up sheets and calendars to populate these sections. The "SPECIAL EVENTS" section is for notable occasions such as the Pledge Ceremony, Overnighter, and Initiations.
4. Add committee meeting locations and links to minutes.
5. Once you're done, click the "GENERATE" button in the "MAIN DETAILS" section to generate the markup for the digest. The code will show up on the right side of the screen.
6. Click "RENDER" to open a new tab with the rendered digest.
7. If you need to make any changes to the content, close the rendered window, and make sure to generate the code again before rendering to see the changes.
8. If you're adventurous, you make edits to the code in the text box after generating, and before rendering.
9. If you're happy with the results of the render, with the rendered tab open, click "Select All" in the Edit menu, copy the entire page, and paste it into an email client (Apple Mail works very well for this).
10. Send the digest out to the brotherhood!
